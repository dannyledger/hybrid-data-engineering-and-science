## 🤖 Module 4: Core Data Science & ML Principles

### 🧠 Overview
This module focuses on foundational data science and machine learning concepts. Inspired by *Data Science from Scratch*, it guides us through building core ML models from the ground up, reinforcing our understanding of how they work. We’ll also contrast our implementations with scikit-learn equivalents to solidify applied fluency.

### 🧪 Tasks & Exercises
- [ ] Manually implement linear regression from scratch (using lists and functions)
- [ ] Build k-Nearest Neighbours classifier using basic Python structures
- [ ] Create a decision tree using recursion and dictionaries
- [ ] Load a real dataset and train the same models using scikit-learn
- [ ] Compare performance between scratch and sklearn versions using metrics

### 📄 Project
**Title:** Core ML Models: From Scratch to Application
**Deliverables:**
- Python scripts for each implementation: `linear_regression.py`, `k_nearest_neighbors.py`, `decision_trees.py`
- Notebooks comparing those with sklearn: `ml_practice_notebooks/`
- `README.md` with theory explanations and reflections

### 📝 Progress Log (`core_concepts_notes.md`)
Use this to track:
- Concepts from each *Data Science from Scratch* chapter
- Implementation challenges
- Design decisions (e.g., recursive vs iterative logic)
- Accuracy gaps or performance differences
