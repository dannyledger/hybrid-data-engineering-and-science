# Hybrid Data Engineering + Data Science Learning Path
### Moving away from Datacamp's approach, and into something more unique to me.

> **My prompt to GenAI:** Provide me with a learning journey which is self-directed and structured to explore various disciplines within data - from engineering to science. It should be designed to build my confidence, fluency, and hands-on capability through a practical, project-based approach without being tied to industry pressure or trends. I want to understand how to both handle data and discover with it.

## 📦 Module 1: Data Engineering & Foundations
- SQL (joins, subqueries, window functions)
- Pandas (cleaning, grouping, reshaping)
- File formats: CSV, JSON, Parquet
- Data modelling: star & snowflake
- Cloud basics: AWS S3, IAM roles

**✅ Project:** Raw CSV → Cleaned Parquet → Upload to S3

---

## 🔁 Module 2: Pipelines & Orchestration
- ETL/ELT workflows
- Airflow / Prefect DAG setup
- Scheduling, dependencies
- Logging + pipeline testing with pytest
